			<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>

			<h2>Subject</h2>
			<p>To explore and understand the structure of a file using HTML and CSS. Areas covered included site-wide in addition to page-specific CSS stylesheets, CSS and IMG folders, and the relationship between index.html and the pages that run them.</p>

			<h2>Complications</h2>
			<p>Problems were not really encountered, rather I myself took longer to program because of double-checking the formatting and making sure everything was how I wanted it to be. </p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Created a base homepage with heading, paragraph, and link formatting along with the placement of images. Additionally, this page was constructed as a summary of the results from the lab, all while utilizing a similar formatting style.</p>
